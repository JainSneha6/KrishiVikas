## Problem Statement

<div align="center">

 <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cafffacd-a5e9-49f1-a08e-f025cd1ac6f8"  width="700"/>

</div>

Farmers, especially those managing less than 2 hectares of land, face multiple challenges:

1. **Sub-optimal Crop Selection**  
   Traditional intuition often drives crop choice, ignoring soil, weather, and market factors.

2. **Late or Missed Disease Diagnosis**  
   Visual symptoms go unnoticed or misidentified, leading to crop losses.

3. **Unpredictable Yield & Storage Planning**  
   Lack of accurate yield forecasts hampers storage, finance, and resource planning.

4. **Poor Post-Harvest Price Forecasting**  
   No reliable market trend data leads to sub-optimal selling times.

5. **Invisible In-Field Issues**  
   Pests, nutrient deficiencies, and flooding incidents often remain unreported and unaddressed.

6. **Income Instability**  
   Crop failures leave farmers without alternative livelihood guidance.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Agro-Climatic Crop Recommendation

**Description:**  
Recommends the most suitable crop varieties for a farmer‚Äôs region based on agro-climatic conditions like temperature, rainfall, soil type, and seasonal variations.

**Tech Stack:**
- **NLP:** AgriBERT  
- **Frontend:** React, Ionic  
- **Backend:** Flask  
- **External APIs:** Weather APIs, Soil databases  

**How It Works:**
- AgriBERT interprets location-specific agricultural text and historical patterns.
- Real-time weather and soil data are parsed to identify optimal crop matches.
- Recommendations are visualized via an interactive crop calendar with planting/harvesting schedules.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Plant Disease Identification

**Description:**  
Allows farmers to upload images of infected crops/leaves to instantly detect diseases and receive treatment advice.

**Tech Stack:**
- **Deep Learning:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN with TensorFlow)  
- **Frontend:** Image Upload Interface (React/Ionic)  
- **Backend:** Flask API  
- **Model Training:** ImageNet-pretrained CNN fine-tuned on plant disease datasets  

**How It Works:**
- User uploads a photo of the plant or leaf.
- The image is processed by a CNN classifier trained to detect over 30 common crop diseases.
- Based on diagnosis, the system provides recommended pesticide and organic treatment options.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Precision Yield Forecasting

**Description:**  
Predicts expected crop yield per hectare using key farm-level inputs such as area, fertilizer usage, crop type, and weather data.

**Tech Stack:**
- **Machine Learning:** Support Vector Machines (SVM via scikit-learn)  
- **Backend:** Flask  
- **Frontend:** React dashboards  
- **Data Inputs:** Historical yield records, weather APIs, fertilizer logs  

**How It Works:**
- SVM regression models trained on multi-year agricultural datasets forecast yield potential.
- Forecasts are visualized for seasonal planning and irrigation scheduling.
- Suggestions for crop rotation and input optimization are provided alongside.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Market Price Forecasting

**Description:**  
Provides short and mid-term predictions of crop prices using time-series models to help farmers choose optimal selling times.

**Tech Stack:**
- **Time-Series Modeling:** SARIMA (statsmodels)  
- **Frontend:** Dynamic D3.js/Chart.js visualizations  
- **Backend:** Flask API  
- **Data Source:** Historical mandi prices, open agri-market data  

**How It Works:**
- SARIMA models analyze seasonal patterns in market price fluctuations.
- Users can explore price trends over days/weeks/months for selected crops.
- Forecasts are combined with region-specific market demand insights.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Crowdsourced Problem Reporting

**Description:**  
Allows farmers to report localized problems like pest outbreaks, nutrient deficiencies, or flood damage, which are clustered and prioritized using geospatial intelligence.

**Tech Stack:**
- **Clustering Algorithms:** DBSCAN for geo-tag clustering  
- **Categorization:** K-Means + NLP classifiers (Scikit-learn)  
- **Severity Scoring:** Hybrid Rule-Based + ML classification  
- **Frontend:** Map-based UI (Leaflet.js)  
- **Backend:** Flask  

**How It Works:**
- Reports submitted by farmers are geotagged and categorized using K-Means and NLP keyword extraction.
- DBSCAN clusters incidents to detect regional problem hotspots.
- Severity is auto-assessed to prioritize government or NGO response.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ KrishiSahayak Chatbot ‚Äì Alternative Income Advisor

**Description:**  
Conversational AI chatbot that guides farmers on diversifying income through activities like dairy, poultry, apiculture, and agro-tourism.

**Tech Stack:**
- **NLP Model:** Multilingual BERT (mBERT)  
- **TTS:** Google Text-to-Speech API  
- **Voice Interface:** Web Speech API / Ionic Native Plugins  
- **Backend:** Flask  
- **Frontend:** Chat UI (React/Ionic)  

**How It Works:**
- Farmers interact in their local language via text or voice.
- mBERT processes queries and maps them to curated income options and resources.
- TTS enables accessibility for non-literate users by reading chatbot responses aloud.
