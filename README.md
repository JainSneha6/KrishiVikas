## Problem Statement

<div align="center">

 <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cafffacd-a5e9-49f1-a08e-f025cd1ac6f8"  width="700"/>

</div>

Farmers, especially those managing less than 2 hectares of land, face multiple challenges:

1. **Sub-optimal Crop Selection**  
   Traditional intuition often drives crop choice, ignoring soil, weather, and market factors.

2. **Late or Missed Disease Diagnosis**  
   Visual symptoms go unnoticed or misidentified, leading to crop losses.

3. **Unpredictable Yield & Storage Planning**  
   Lack of accurate yield forecasts hampers storage, finance, and resource planning.

4. **Poor Post-Harvest Price Forecasting**  
   No reliable market trend data leads to sub-optimal selling times.

5. **Invisible In-Field Issues**  
   Pests, nutrient deficiencies, and flooding incidents often remain unreported and unaddressed.

6. **Income Instability**  
   Crop failures leave farmers without alternative livelihood guidance.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Agro-Climatic Crop Recommendation  
üîç **Description:**  
Farmers receive crop recommendations suited to their region‚Äôs climate, soil, and season using a fine-tuned BERT model trained on agricultural domain data (**AgriBERT**). Recommendations also include interactive crop calendars that dynamically adjust for weather forecasts.

üîß **Tech Stack:**  
- **Frontend:** React (web) / Ionic React (mobile) with calendar visualization libraries (e.g., FullCalendar.js)  
- **Backend:** Flask / FastAPI for model serving  
- **Model:** Fine-tuned AgriBERT (transformer) on labeled agri-domain corpora  
- **Data Sources:** IMD weather APIs, ISRO/Bhuvan soil maps, local agri departments  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with PostGIS for geospatial queries  

üß† **How Tech is Used:**  
- Input: Location coordinates, soil type, weather  
- NLP with AgriBERT to understand agronomic advisories  
- Model inference ranks suitable crops  
- Calendar auto-generates crop schedules based on regional climate  


### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Plant Disease Identification  
üîç **Description:**  
Farmers upload photos of infected leaves. A CNN-based image classifier detects the disease and suggests remedial treatments, including pesticide or organic options.

üîß **Tech Stack:**  
- **Frontend:** React / Ionic with image upload & preview (Cropper.js)  
- **Backend:** Flask / TensorFlow Serving for model inference  
- **Model:** CNN architecture (e.g., ResNet50 or MobileNet for edge-friendliness)  
- **Database:** MongoDB or Firebase for storing images and metadata  

üß† **How Tech is Used:**  
- Uploaded leaf image is processed and classified using a CNN  
- Based on the detected disease class, a treatment recommendation engine fetches pesticide info from a curated dataset or API  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Precision Yield Forecasting  
üîç **Description:**  
Uses Support Vector Machines (SVM) trained on historical crop data to predict expected yield. Provides actionable insights such as crop rotation, fertilizer planning, and irrigation schedules.

üîß **Tech Stack:**  
- **Frontend:** Charts with D3.js or Chart.js for yield visualization  
- **Backend:** Flask + Scikit-learn for SVM modeling  
- **Model:** SVM regressor trained on features like land area, fertilizer quantity, rainfall, etc.  
- **Data Sources:** Agmarknet, ICAR datasets, Farmer-reported data  
- **Database:** MySQL / PostgreSQL  

üß† **How Tech is Used:**  
- Farmers input data like sowing time, area, inputs used  
- Model returns predicted yield  
- Expert system layer advises on optimization (e.g., nitrogen/phosphorus levels) 

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Market Price Forecasting  
üîç **Description:**  
Uses SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models for time-series forecasting of crop prices. Helps farmers time their sales for profit maximization.

üîß **Tech Stack:**  
- **Frontend:** Highcharts or Recharts for trend visualization  
- **Backend:** Python (Statsmodels for SARIMA)  
- **Data Sources:** Agmarknet, eNAM, local mandi feeds  
- **Database:** TimescaleDB (for time-series optimized PostgreSQL)  

üß† **How Tech is Used:**  
- SARIMA model trained on historical mandi price data  
- User selects crop and region ‚Üí future price trends displayed  
- Suggests optimal harvest or storage durations  

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Crowdsourced Problem Reporting  
üîç **Description:**  
Farmers report issues like pest outbreaks, waterlogging, etc. These are clustered and geo-mapped using DBSCAN and categorized using NLP + K-means. Severity scoring combines ML and rule-based logic.

üîß **Tech Stack:**  
- **Frontend:** Interactive maps with Leaflet.js or Mapbox  
- **Backend:** Python with Scikit-learn (DBSCAN, K-means), spaCy/NLTK  
- **Geospatial DB:** PostGIS  
- **Storage:** Firebase for real-time sync or MongoDB  

üß† **How Tech is Used:**  
- Reports submitted via app (text + geolocation)  
- Clustering (DBSCAN) identifies outbreak zones  
- NLP categorizes issue type; severity scored  
- Visual alerts on map + dashboard for authorities  

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ KrishiSahayak Chatbot  
üîç **Description:**  
AI-powered chatbot assistant that suggests alternative income sources like apiculture or agro-tourism. Supports multilingual, voice, and offline capabilities.

üîß **Tech Stack:**  
- **Frontend:** Ionic React + Web Speech API (for voice input/output)  
- **Bot Framework:** Rasa / Dialogflow / Microsoft Bot Framework  
- **NLP Model:** BERT / IndicBERT (for Indian language understanding)  
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Google Cloud TTS / Amazon Polly  
- **Languages:** Hindi, Marathi, Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, etc.  

üß† **How Tech is Used:**  
- Chatbot NLP parses user's request (‚ÄúHow to start poultry farming?‚Äù)  
- Fetches curated guides or summarizes from agri knowledge base  
- Offers voice-based interaction for low-literacy users  
- Supports offline mode via PWA and caching FAQs
