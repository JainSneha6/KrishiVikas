## Problem Statement

<div align="center">

 <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cafffacd-a5e9-49f1-a08e-f025cd1ac6f8"  width="700"/>

</div>

Farmers, especially those managing less than 2 hectares of land, face multiple challenges:

1. **Sub-optimal Crop Selection**  
   Traditional intuition often drives crop choice, ignoring soil, weather, and market factors.

2. **Late or Missed Disease Diagnosis**  
   Visual symptoms go unnoticed or misidentified, leading to crop losses.

3. **Unpredictable Yield & Storage Planning**  
   Lack of accurate yield forecasts hampers storage, finance, and resource planning.

4. **Poor Post-Harvest Price Forecasting**  
   No reliable market trend data leads to sub-optimal selling times.

5. **Invisible In-Field Issues**  
   Pests, nutrient deficiencies, and flooding incidents often remain unreported and unaddressed.

6. **Income Instability**  
   Crop failures leave farmers without alternative livelihood guidance.
